if someone sends the block having the perfect nonce value and 
someone in the network decides to change the coinbase transaction alone
it would be invalid since the block no longer hashes to the required one.

question:

// okay, first we have x number of transactions in mempool
// we pick first n, (n<x) by sorting by fees descending ah
// the n is packed into a block, rest is left for next block
// how are the 6 confirmations made? can someone fake it
// after leaking the nonce?    
// If I put like an arbitrary number of transactions in it
// whats the chance it'll get accepted?


answer:

so, confirmation refers to the number of blocks that are mined after the block
where your transaction was put.

6 confirmations means that 6 blocks were mined after your transaction.
it's recommended to wait just in case something goes wrong with the 
blocks.
