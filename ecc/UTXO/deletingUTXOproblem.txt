lets take the case where we see a transaction in the mempool.

so, the right thing to do is delete the inputs of the transaction from
our UTXO set.

what if the mempool we currently have, is told to be discarded 
once a miner mines a block?

we would have to revert all changes we did to the UTXO set because 
of the mempool we once had.

Then delete every referenced input from the block in the UTXO set.

----------------------------------------------------------------

what we can do is have all changes from mempool be dones in UTXO.tmp

Then when this particular node finds the block hash by adjusting nonce

it can transmit it from main_z and we pick it up from main_f and 

process it.
