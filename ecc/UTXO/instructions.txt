So,
This is the UTXO set which is used to find the unspent transactions 
in blocks.

as transactions are spent, using txids, txs are removed from the 
blocks.

its not possible to know which tx is from which block, so we 
iteratively check EVERY block.

The structure is similar to balances.txt in usr_cache but we 
store the entire transactions in that block.

so, { blockn : str(tx in blockn), ..}
stored as a whole as string

so one decode for whole thing.

then another decode for the str(tx in blockn) part
