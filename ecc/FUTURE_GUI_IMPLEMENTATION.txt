Add scale widget for spending balance, max being remaining balance.


==================================================
yes, check python multi processing.
Or multi threading (you have to customize the other script and import it in the main script to make it run from the parent script).

Or you can also do this:

    import os 
     
    filenames = [name for i in os.listdir(os.getcwd()) if i.endswith('.py')] 
    for file in filenames: 
	os.system(f"python3 {file}") 

this will launch all your python files in the same
 directory as this script!
