This BITCOIN PROJECT uses the UTXO model and mining block method to verify transactions 
just like the real one

It uses the local LAN broadcast address as a replacement for the P2P network in the
real bitcoin.

All devices operating in the same LAN should work

This includes :
    * All devices connected to the same WIFI (eg: ITdepartment)
    * All devices in the LAB
    * All devices in a local WIFI hotspot (can use termux)

This relying on the P2P network is similar in the fact that the more the participents
better the reliability against common attack vectors
