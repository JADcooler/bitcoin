// identify UTXOs

-> UTXOs() #gives txid and output index

// choose amount and receiver pubkey

-> neededUTXO(amount)
   
-> make_inp()

-> pay(amount, to)

// transaction is now made, we broadcast

-> broadcast(tr)

// we listen to transaction
// then we update available UTXOs by removing ones we used as inp


-> #[MAIN_F] method that takes transaction, enters to mempool 

-> lets see mining later
 
// okay, first we have x number of transactions in mempool
// we pick first n, (n<x) by sorting by fees descending ah
// the n is packed into a block, rest is left for next block
// how are the 6 confirmations made? can someone fake it
// after leaking the nonce?
// If I put like an arbitrary number of transactions in it
// whats the chance it'll get accepted?
