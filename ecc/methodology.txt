// identify UTXOs

-> UTXOs() #gives txid and output index

// choose amount and receiver pubkey

-> neededUTXO(amount)
   
-> make_inp()

-> pay(amount, to)

// transaction is now made, we broadcast

-> broadcast(tr)

// we listen to transaction
// then we update available UTXOs by removing ones we used as inp

// so.. I'm removing an UTXO after entering it to mempool
// then I get a block that has already added the tx.


// I have to add a mechanism to make permanent changes to
// UTXO.txt only after block is added.

-> UTXO.tmp

// when there's a block received. we deleteUTXO() in UTXO.txt
// if some input doesn't exist, we reject block


// in script, we can choose arbitrary time to start mining.
// mining is done with current mempool.txt txs.


-> //mempool is limited in size, how many characters can I send?
   //tr tr ah we can send instead of in bulk. in case some
   //new node requests it.
