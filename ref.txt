#me
transactions are valid only when they are in a block. 
you can only specifiy valid transactions in your transaction input (they are in some block)

#irl	
TIL the the UTXO set includes unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. This explains how unconfirmed outputs can be spent before being mined. Thanks! â€“
